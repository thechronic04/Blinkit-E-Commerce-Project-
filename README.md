# 2. Item Category Insights

Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods are the top revenue-generating categories (≈ $0.18M each).
Categories like Seafood, Breakfast, and Starchy Foods show very low sales, indicating:
Limited demand
Stocking or visibility issues
Wrong customer targeting

# 3. Fat Content Sales Pattern

Regular Fat items contribute more to total sales (≈ $776K) than Low Fat items (≈ $425K).
This suggests:
Customers prefer regular variants

Possibly higher margins in regular-fat items

# 4. Outlet Size Performance

Large (High) outlet size has the highest sales contribution: $507K.
Small and Medium outlets combined contribute almost the same but still lag behind:
Medium: $248K
Small: $444K

# 5. Outlet Location Insights

Tier 3 locations show the highest sales (≈ $472K).
Tier 2 is second (≈ $393K), followed by Tier 1 (≈ $336K).
This indicates:
Higher adoption in suburban / semi-urban areas
Competitive pricing suits Tier-3 customers
Potential for expansion in Tier-3 geographies

Steady sales increase from 2010 to 2018.

Suggests:
Market saturation
More competition
Need for strategy refresh post-2018

# 7. Outlet Type Insights

Supermarket Type 1 generates the highest revenue: $787.55K.
Grocery stores generate the lowest: $151.94K.
Supermarket formats have:

# 8. Customer Rating & Item Visibility

Outlets with higher visibility generally have higher sales, showing a positive correlation.
Customer rating is fairly stable (≈4), meaning:
Customer experience is consistent across outlet types
Opportunity exists to push ratings above 4.5 through service improvements

# Overall Conclusion

The dashboard reveals that:
Tier-3 locations and Large outlets are the strongest revenue drivers.
Supermarket formats outperform grocery stores significantly.
Customer awareness (visibility) strongly influences sales.
Blinkit’s top-selling categories are fresh produce and snacks, while niche categories underperform.
